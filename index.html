        <h1><strong>💙 A Coffee for Two 💙</strong></h1>
        
        <p>
            Aanya rushed into the café, out of breath. She had five minutes before her interview, 
            and of course, today was the day she forgot to set her alarm.<br><br>
            "One black coffee, please!" she said hurriedly.<br><br>
            "Make that two," a voice beside her added.<br><br>
            She turned to see a man smiling at her, his eyes warm and familiar. 
            "You always forget to eat when you're nervous," he said.
        </p>

        <p id="para">
            Aanya blinked in surprise. "How do you—?"<br><br>
            The barista placed two coffees on the counter. Her usual order.<br><br>
            Then it hit her.<br><br>
            "Rohan?" she whispered.
        </p>

        <p>
            He grinned. "Took you long enough. It’s been ten years, but I still remember how you bite 
            your lip before big moments."<br><br>
            She laughed, shaking her head. "And you still order extra sugar in my coffee, don’t you?"<br><br>
            He held up the cup. "Some things never change."<br><br>
            As she took the first sip, she realized—maybe this was one of those moments where 
            life surprises you in the sweetest way.
